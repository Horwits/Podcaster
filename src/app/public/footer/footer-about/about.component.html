            <p>The Podcaster teamwork project was created as part of Telerik Academy 2015-2016 "Single-page Applications with Angular 2"
            course. The authors are Daniel Nikolov and Angela Teneva - team Directive4. The project is a single-page application
            created to podcast amazing contents, such as audio, video, photos, text and any information which could be podcasted
            in Internet. The application works fine on any device: mobile, tablet, laptop, or desktop, playing the role of
            a pod just like the iPod. Tehnical specifications: We used Angular2, Typescript and Bootstrap. Server is powered
            by Firebase. Unit tests were written using Karma. Link to the project's repository
